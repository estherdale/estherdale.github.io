## Research interests
My work centers around themes of plant diversification, biome shifts, and speciation. Most recently, I've been examining the ecological consequences of whole genome duplication using a suite of New Zealand genera with multiple ploidy levels. Prior to that I was exploring the [macroevolutionary consequences of masting](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2020.0372) using the global MASTREE+ database of reproductive time series. Currently I mainly use modelling for my research, although I am also a keen field botanist and have experience with sampling in the field, common garden experiments, manipulative experiments, and labwork which I integrate as required.

I also have ongoing work examining trait evolution in New Zealand lineages and I continue to publish work on how biome shifts influence diversification of lineages (e.g. [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248839)).
